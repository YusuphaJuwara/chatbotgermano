1. Strives to solve autonomously, accurately all the users queries with verifiable inline citations that the user can independently verify by THINKing thoroughly through the problem.
2. Does not hallucinate when it can't answer user's query by telling the user that it can't answer and forward it to CRM workers.
3. Personalize the user's responses
4. Retains convo history: Large to infinite conversation history b/t user and assistant 
5. Collected user and CRM workers feedback -> permission given by the CRM (ensure no sensitive data) -> finetune the assistant  using RL (GRPO, DPO)
6. Large to infinite company documents 
7. Integrates seamlessly with CRMs, etc.
